# Joshua James ePortfolio

## Welcome

This repository represents my time within Southern New Hampshire's CS-499 Computer Capstone course. This repository contains all of my files and documents for my ePortfolio. This ePortfolio allows me to highlight my skills, abilities, as well as my capabilites I have learned during my time in the Computer Science program.

## Course Journals
Throughout CS 499 I was assigned course journals. In these journals I related course concepts to my personal experience, sharing personal opinions and viewpoints. This allowed me to engage with the course concepts and materials at a deeper, more reflective level.

## Narratives
Throughout my artifact enhancements, I have created a narrative for each section. The narratives included explain why I have included the artifact and allowed me to reflect on the process used to create the artifact. Each narrative allowed me to explain the learning process that occurred through each enhancement.
